I am not aware of any university run participant pools . 	At the universities I 've worked in North America , human-subject studies -LRB- esp . 	2
Apart from admission -LRB- which normally should not be related to age -RRB- , there is something that 's related to your question . 	Age is not a PhD admission facor in the continental Europe , too . 	3
This post refers to research in the STEM fields , and may not be applicable to other research topics . 	This is about my experience in computer engineering I found that reading for breadth was the more important approach . 	4
If you do n't want to pay for Adobe Acrobat Pro , as @schultem mentions , LaTeX can do this with embedded hyperlinks . 	If you do n't mind hosting your files online , SlideShare is a good solution . 	5
I do n't think there are likely to be any standards that address this issue specifically . 	You 're going to find answers all over the map for this one -LRB- i.e. , there probably are n't `` standards '' -RRB- . 	6
My answer would be depending on which GRE are you referring to ? 	The problem I see with the GREs is that the scoring range is highly compressed . 	7
If you have access to it , you can very easily do that with Thomson Reuters ' Web of Science portal . 	In general there are a number of different distinct workflows that lead to a poster . 	For completeness , Apple 's Pages has quite a few nice poster layouts . 	9
It is perfectly okay to ask for the figure knowing well that the other person may not give . 	You can always ask , then it is the choice of the author to accept or not . 	10
The academic year does start around September in the USA and I think most European countries . 	I would not accelerate things , to avoid getting worse grades that you want . 	11
I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A ! 	You could defer admission , but it 's a little unusual to defer for a year . 	12
Edit , again : The question seems to have changed , yet again . 	I can think of three reasons why a faculty member might reveal how a student performed on a qualifying examination . 	13
I agree with Seteropere completely , `` Network Science '' is a very broad subject . 	I would say you are approaching it in the wrong way . 	14
Supporting an ideology in an ostentatious manner -LRB- rather than privately or discreetly -RRB- is a personality problem . 	I think for an appropriate answer I 'd need to know exactly what the ` bad ' ideology is . 	15
This does not fully answer your question , but it is certainly one consideration . 	I am a PhD student in Computational Science , which is an interdisciplinary major spanning mathematics , computer science , and engineerning . 	16
A few possible problems : 1 -RRB- Such an ID system seems a little intrusive . 	In mathematics , we already have a database of this sort - two them , in fact , with in MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH . 	17
As an complement to the other answers , let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking . 	The other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense . 	18
Stars are rotating , but that 's not the cause for their stability . 	Stars rotate due to the angular momentum of the gas they formed from . 	19
It indeed appears the Andromeda galaxy -LRB- M31 -RRB- and The Milky Way -LRB- MW -RRB- are en route to a collision . 	In a few billion years , the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide . 	20
The short answer is : we are made from the `` stuff '' contributed by many stars . 	It is highly unlikely that we 're made out of stuff from only one star . 	21
All we know is this : Distant objects are receding from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us . 	The expansion of space means that objects in cosmological distances are receding away from each other . 	22
Like Chris said above , stars rotate to conserve their angular momentum . 	Stars are rotating , but that 's not the cause for their stability . 	23
According to this website the peak visible magnitude will be about 10.5 around February 2nd . 	The AAVSO data seems to indicate that it might have already peaked , at around 10.5 -LRB- visual -RRB- . 	24
All of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle . 	I will be specific to answering the part regarding the prediction of solar flares . 	25

Let us assume the data for a globular cluster to be equivalent to that of M13 . 	Globular clusters occupy an interesting place in the spectrum of composite stellar systems . 	28
As per your definition , a star formed in a binary system -LRB- hence near some gravitating body -RRB- is a generalised planet . 	The main flaw with your definition of a `` generalised planet '' would be the boundary between stars and planets . 	30
A method used to calculate the distance between stars is 3 Dimensional trigonometry . 	You only need two-dimensional trigonometry if you know the distances to the two stars and their angular separation . 	31
The farther away , the faster the galaxies move away from us . 	Here is my answer to a similar question posted on the physics stack exchange website . 	32
Stars form in star-formation regions , which itself develop from molecular clouds . 	It may be possible for a solar system like ours to exist outside of a galaxy . 	33
A black hole -LRB- briefly -RRB- , is nothing more than a dead star whose mass was more than 3 solar masses . 	I think you mean to ask , `` What is the local sidereal time of Greenwhich ? '' . 	34
Yes , but it does not stay in the same constellation . 	Constellations are human constructs to make sense of the night sky . 	35
Asteroids are what are called minor planets - small inner solar system rocky bodies . 	The objects you are refering to are actually two different objects : asteroids and comets . 	36
Here is a lexical decision task I wrote years ago using PHP and Javascript -LRB- github link -RRB- . 	Just for reference , I ended up writing simple web-based lexical decision task software myself . 	37
It 's pretty difficult to imagine a person with Social Anxiety Disorder being an extrovert . 	On the surface , it does seem like social anxiety disorder and extroversion should n't both exist in the same person . 	38
It is hard to delineate emotion completely from thoughts or sensations , because emotion can contain both . 	Technically speaking , an emotion is not different from thought the way it is processed in brain , both involve neurotransmitters . 	39
I 've found an additional concept that may be related to the original question : prototype theory . 	According to current models of human concept learning , the answer to your question is both . 	40
There are individuals who possess extraordinary memory ability , sometimes called eidetic memory . 	There are many arguments for why this is not the case . 	41
Spike trigger is a specific type or you could say a sub-set of reverse correlations , covariance and probabilities . 	There 's the naïve version of spike triggered averaging , and the sophisticated version . 	42
As mentioned in the other comments , ANOVA is problematic when mixing types of predictor variables . 	I like to think of multitasking as rapid task switching . 	43
Q : What is the reason for people to implicitly trust their peers in extreme -LRB- or not -RRB- situations ? 	One human-being reliance on other -LRB- s -RRB- awareness is defined by the level of trust between the humans . 	44
Intrinsic reward is the emotional pay-off that you get by completing an activity . 	According to Frederick Herzberg 's two-factor theory of motivation , intrinsic rewards are motivators -LRB- e.g. 	45
Presumably the decision of drivers to slow down in response to work zone signage is influenced by many factors . 	This short talk deals with issues of `` cheating slightly '' : Dan Ariely : Our buggy moral code . 	46
When studying adult IQ , general adult norms are often used . 	Basically , what you do is you compare each age group IQ to the standardization sample . 	47
Some ancient historical precedent exists for preferring $ 10 $ , but also for $ 6 $ , so that 's mixed support from Wikipedia on perfect numbers . 	This is indeed possible , but I have n't seen it done experimentally for reasons other than feasibility . 	48
These are interesting studies , but the bottom line is : yes , environment affects cognitive abilities . 	I 'm not sure what you mean by cognitive capacity , but I absolutely believe that language shapes the way we think . 	49
Since this is a relatively new problem for behavioral researchers , I do n't know that there is a common consensus . 	I 'll address just the first of your three sub-questions , the others have been answered by Chuck Sherrington . 	50
If non-human animals do have intelligence too , why is their intelligence not as advanced as humans ? 	Your own theory is bad because it seems to follow from a Lamarkian interpretation of evolutionary theory . 	51
The Hare Psychopathy Checklist is often used to assess psychopathy in clinical settings . 	From an article entitled Can You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psychopath ? 	52
I wrap steaks individually in freezer paper , then put them into ziploc freezer bags . 	Wrap well in plastic -LRB- individually -RRB- and then put in a freezer bag . 	53
In addition to oil , make sure the grill is nice and hot before you start cooking . 	I 'd been using paper towels to oil the grill , and I just discovered that newspapers work a lot better . 	54
The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling . 	Soak whole ears in the husk in a bowl of water . 	55
There are actually quite a few differences between the different types of flour . 	The difference is the amount of protein contained in the flour which can range from 5 % to 15 % . 	56
I 've never adjusted the length of time based on number of eggs . 	I do n't boil eggs enough to keep a feel for the timing ... 	57
I just hold the cheese closer to the edge away from the grater . 	By the wording of the question , I 'm pretty sure you 're using one of those pyramidal graters or a `` sheet '' grater . 	58
I 've stored pancakes in the freezer for over two month and not had any freezer burn . 	Its going to depend on the type of packaging and also the freezer . 	59
Break the bulb into cloves , breaking off the bottom and the dry stick that goes up the middle . 	lay down a knife horizontaly on the cloves and hit it . 	60
I managed to find this recipe , I think this is where I got the idea . 	I 've only made a couple of bbq sauces , but they 've always come out really well . 	61
I believe one can not taste the difference between minced -LRB- canned -RRB- and fresh garlic once it is cooked . 	In my experience , fresh garlic is great for when you want texture , or to slow down the flavour infusion . 	62
I grill salmon that I get with the skin on . 	Salmon is a great choice and it 's readily available pretty much everywhere . 	63
The recipe I work from has you put the meat in the freezer , then pan sear it . 	Starting with a whole chilled piece of meat , I quickly pour boiling water over all the outside surface . 	64
They do n't taste identical at all , and even more important , they do n't smell the same . 	Black pepper and white pepper are differing preparations of the fruit of the Piper nigrum plant . 	65
This depends on the shelf life of the cultivar of tomato you purchased . 	Tomatoes will last longer if kept in the fridge , but I actually recommend against keeping them there . 	66
Coagulated egg proteins in combination with gluten give baked goods the supporting structure they need . 	There are basically two types of cakes : butter and sponge -LRB- or Génoise -RRB- . 	67
A common one is haddock and is in season pretty much year round . 	White fish are , as a rule , more delicately flavored than darker fleshed fish . 	68
Copper can be useful for certain tasks due to the its metallic properties -LRB- heats quickly , distributes heat evenly , etc. . 	Probably subjective , but ... Good clad stainless steel will give you much better cooking performance per dollar than copper . 	70
She obviously has a legit excuse , although she could have been more responsible and `` have '' told you in advance . 	The first have covers both been more responsible and told you in that sentence . 	71
In some cases the implication could even be that Tom does not love her . 	There is no implication about Tom whatsoever in such a sentence . 	72
I agree with others -LRB- and yourself -RRB- in that I have never heard this phrase in English . 	I have never heard or seen the phrase you mention . 	73
The assertion is false , at least as you 've restated it here . 	`` I had mainly been '' is fine , in the context you 're using it . 	74

I see some references to status as uncountable as well , but that does n't make much sense to me . 	There are some cases `` status '' may be accounted of countable . 	76
If I understand you correctly , you are looking for a hypernym of inclusion and exclusion . 	Inclusion is the act of including and exclusion is the act of excluding . 	77
Firstly , you should be aware that there are two different kinds of dashes : the en dash and the em dash . 	Semicolon is used to join sentences that can stand alone , but are joined to emphasize their relationship . 	78

The room used for defecation is almost always referred to by euphemism . 	I 'm English , and would probably use ` toilet ' most of the time , and always in the context of a private home . 	83
I can only think of context using insofar as or insofar that . 	The form insofar is American English ; the standard form in British and other English is ` in so far ' . 	84
As others have said , `` ten of six '' , though not used in many English speaking areas , would be understood as 5:50 . 	`` Ten of six '' probably means 5:50 but I have not heard it before . 	85
Certainly many usage guides have advised against use of this `` singular they '' on various `` logical '' grounds . 	This may be overly obvious , but in American English , saying `` you 're welcome '' is certainly polite and standard . 	I 'm not sure how `` Not at all '' sounds in response to `` thank you '' . 	87
Back in the day , `` cable '' was used to describe communications sent abroad . 	The word `` cable '' has its origins in the days of the telegraph . 	88
Those expressions could have slightly different meanings especially when talking about finance . 	I suspect the phrase originated in the habit of drawing the internet as a cloud shape on network diagrams . 	89
In the United States , jails are operated by cities and counties -LRB- or equivalent -RRB- . 	Yes , your sentence will be clearer if you write the actual word instead of the slash .

So you know , I do not have personal experience with this . 	Since you 've already accepted a nicely sourced answer , I 'll contribute some unsubstatiated tradition -LRB- i.e. 	116
In the past it has grown almost like a weed in our pots on our deck here in North Texas . 	Additional to the other answers , basil famously does n't like to be damp overnight . 	117
There is a very full description of the various types of hormone rooting compound here . 	It is meant to stimulate root growth - in particular to stimulate the creation of roots . 	118
I found it difficult to mark just one answer as correct because all are . 	I reccomend `` Monkey Grass '' because it is like a slow growing weed that reproduces slowly and looks nice ! 	119
Simple answer is yes , flower shoots on lettuce is a sure sign of bolting . 	It appears as though it has likely started to bolt . 	120
Dirt can mean pretty much anything , from good to poor quality soil . 	Use coco peat - It 's an organic soil derived from coconut husks for garden vegetables and plants which is Eco-friendly . 	121
If you can get over the `` ick factor , '' you have an easily-applied source of organic nitrogen fertilizer close at hand . 	The NPK numbers on the fertilizer represents the percent , by weight , of Nitrogen , P2O5 and K2O , respectively . 	122
The point of aerating your pile is to get oxygen to the microbes that break down the organic matter . 	Your pile will compost without turning it , but it goes faster if you turn it . 	123
I bought a book , which talks about this , so here 's an answer to my own question . 	Well I would n't risk it , not in a cold compost system . 	124
Aloes , like most succulents , are very hardy and will withstand considerable neglect . 	Some of the guys at my office have potted aloe plants . 	125
This looks a lot like an invitation to a No True Scottsman argument . 	I concur with @T . E.D ; the question is a `` no True Scotsman '' bar bet . 	126

Preserving grammaticality and preserving meaning of the sentence are two different things . 	In fact , you can remove pretty much and preserve grammaticality if you do n't care about preserving meaning . 	145
In some nowadays Indo-European languages you can still see rests of base-20 numeral systems . 	Modern Englishes , and many other well-known languages , use base 10 -LRB- ie decimal -RRB- systems of numerals . 	146
The difficulty arises not from the various linguistic properties of the language pair as many here suggest . 	It depends on generally syntactic structure of two languages and - yes - some pragmatic issues . 	147
In English , certainly the most common use of do is Do-Support . 	In traditional grammar , the word doing is a participle in all your examples . 	148
A caveat : I 'm experiencing the tail end of a three day migraine . 	I agree with the commentators that your question is a little confusing . 	149
