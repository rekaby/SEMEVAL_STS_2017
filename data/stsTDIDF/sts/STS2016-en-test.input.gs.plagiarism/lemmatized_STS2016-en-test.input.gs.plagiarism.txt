the differ application have a direct influence on what the definition of the term mean . 	the definition of term be dependent on the application . 	200
inheritance be a important feature in object orientate programming . 	the peropo of inheritance in object orient programming be to minimize the reuse of exist code without modification . 	201
in probability theory , the prior and conditional probability of two random event be relate by Bayes ' theorem . 	Bayes ' Theorem be a theorem of probability theory originally state by the Reverend Thomas Bayes . 	202
without a proof of correctness , such a algorithm be likely to fail . 	however a object can not be cast to a class which be no relative of it . 	203
so in essence it be a popularity contest between webpage . 	it be essentially a popularity meter . 	204
several different way of compute these value , additionally know as -lrb- term -rrb- weight , have be develop . 	several different way have be develop of calculate these value -lrb- also know as term weight -rrb- . 	205
the other method be the top down approach which be a method that combine memorization and recursion . 	since the PageRank be the most important algorithm which be use in the Google engine . 	206
the order in which term appear in the document be lose in a vector space representation . 	if a term occur in the document , the value will be non-zero in the vector . 	207
the method take much less time than naive method . 	and thus the method take much less time than more naive method . 	208
inheritance be one of the basic concept of Object Oriented Programming . 	in object orient programming inheritance be also dependant on access level modifier . 	209
as a formal theorem , Bayes ' theorem be valid in all common interpretation of probability . 	Bayes theorem can be use to compute the probability that a propose diagnosis be correct . 	210
thus , the program be the best plan for action that be produce . 	after this , it be use this to pick the best overall path . 	211
the basic idea be to represent each document as a vector of certain weighted word frequency . 	in the vector space model a document be represent as a vector . 	212
object orient programming be a style of programming that support encapsulation , inheritance , and polymorphism . 	inheritance be a basic concept in object orient programming . 	213
the vector space model have some limitation : 1 . 	the limitation of the vector space model be thus . 	214
it be mainly use to calculate the probability of one event 's outcome give that a previous event happen . 	it be also call the posterior probability because it be derive from or depend upon the specify value of B. 	215
the theorem be often use when we have observation and wish to compute posterior probability . 	Bayes theorem can be use to compute the probability that a propose diagnosis be correct . 	216
this can be useful when the number of time a word appear be not consider important . 	it have no relationship to computer programming ; instead it be a process of find a satisfactory algorithm . 	217
in probability theory , Bayes ' theorem relate the conditional and marginal probability of two random event . 	in probability theory , the prior and conditional probability of two random event be relate by Bayes ' theorem . 	218
one of the best know scheme be tf-idf weighting -lrb- see the example below -rrb- . 	one of the best know scheme be tf-idf weighting , propose by Salton , Wong and Yang . 	219
it be therefore use to create relationship between one object and another . 	it also provide a way to generalize du to the `` be a '' relationship between class . 	220
then , use this , the best overall path can be find , thereby demonstrate the dynamic programming principle . 	the further down a inheritance tree you get , the more specific the class become . 	221
when a document be represent as a vector , each dimension correspond to a separate term . 	a document have representation as a vector . 	222
to achieve this , the programmer have to note generalisation and similarity about various aspect of the program . 	it be similar to divide and conquer , however be differentiate as its subproblem be not independent . 	223
the further down a inheritance tree you get , the more specific the class become . 	the differ application have a direct influence on what the definition of the term mean . 	224
the algebraic model for represent text document and object as vector of identifier be call the vector space model . 	the limitation of the vector space model be thus . 	225
in general , dynamic programming be use on optimisation problem , where the most efficient solution be need . 	however , the key in Dynamic Programming be to determine the structure of optimal solution . 	226
it be use in information filter , information retrieval , indexing and relevancy ranking . 	a possible use for a vector space model be for retrieval and filter of information . 	227
the easiest way to look at inheritance be as a `` ... be a kind of '' relationship . 	it also provide a way to generalize du to the `` be a '' relationship between class . 	228
this mean that inheritance be use when type have common factor and these would be put into the superclass . 	it be `` prior '' in the sense that it do not take into account any information about B. 	229
this mean that inheritance be use when type have common factor and these would be put into the superclass . 	the method can be abuse when people deliberately link to site in order to raise a site 's pagerank . 	230
