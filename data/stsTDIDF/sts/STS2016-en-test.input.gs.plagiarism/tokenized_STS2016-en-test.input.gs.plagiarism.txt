The differing application has a direct influence on what the definition of the term means . 	Terms are basically the words or any indexing unit used to identify the contents of a text . 	199
The differing application has a direct influence on what the definition of the term means . 	The definition of term is dependent on the application . 	200
Inheritance is an important feature in object orientated programming . 	The peropos of inheritance in object oriented programming is to minimize the reuse of existing code without modification . 	201
In probability theory , the prior and conditional probabilities of two random events are related by Bayes ' theorem . 	Bayes ' Theorem is a theorem of probability theory originally stated by the Reverend Thomas Bayes . 	202
Without a proof of correctness , such an algorithm is likely to fail . 	However an object can not be cast to a class which is no relative of it . 	203
So in essence it is a popularity contest between WebPages . 	It is essentially a popularity meter . 	204
Several different ways of computing these values , additionally known as -LRB- term -RRB- weights , have been developed . 	Several different ways have been developed of calculating these values -LRB- also known as term weights -RRB- . 	205
The other method is the top down approach which is a method that combines memorization and recursion . 	Since the PageRank is the most important algorithms which is used in the Google engine . 	206
The order in which terms appear in the document is lost in a vector space representation . 	If a term occurs in the document , the value will be non-zero in the vector . 	207
The method takes much less time than naive methods . 	And thus the method takes much less time than more naive methods . 	208
Inheritance is one of the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming . 	In object oriented programming inheritance is also dependant on access level modifiers . 	209
As a formal theorem , Bayes ' theorem is valid in all common interpretations of probability . 	Bayes theorem can be used to compute the probability that a proposed diagnosis is correct . 	210
Thus , the program is the best plan for action that is produced . 	After this , it is using this to pick the best overall path . 	211
The basic idea is to represent each document as a vector of certain weighted word frequencies . 	In the vector space model a document is represented as a vector . 	212
Object oriented programming is a style of programming that supports encapsulation , inheritance , and polymorphism . 	Inheritance is a basic concept in object oriented programming . 	213
The vector space model has some limitations : 1 . 	The limitations of the vector space model are thus . 	214
It is mainly used to calculate the probability of one event 's outcome given that a previous event happened . 	It is also called the posterior probability because it is derived from or depends upon the specified value of B. 	215
The theorem is often used when we have observations and wish to compute posterior probabilities . 	Bayes theorem can be used to compute the probability that a proposed diagnosis is correct . 	216
This can be useful when the number of times a word appears is not considered important . 	It has no relationship to computer programming ; instead it is a process of finding a satisfactory algorithm . 	217
In probability theory , Bayes ' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events . 	In probability theory , the prior and conditional probabilities of two random events are related by Bayes ' theorem . 	218
One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting -LRB- see the example below -RRB- . 	One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting , proposed by Salton , Wong and Yang . 	219
It is therefore used to create relationships between one object and another . 	It also provides a way to generalize du to the `` is a '' relationship between classes . 	220
Then , using this , the best overall path can be found , thereby demonstrating the dynamic programming principle . 	The further down an inheritance tree you get , the more specific the classes become . 	221
When a document is represented as a vector , each dimension corresponds to a separate term . 	A document has representation as a vector . 	222
To achieve this , the programmer has to note generalisations and similarities about various aspects of the program . 	It is similar to divide and conquer , however is differentiated as its subproblems are not independent . 	223
The further down an inheritance tree you get , the more specific the classes become . 	The differing application has a direct influence on what the definition of the term means . 	224
The algebraic model for representing text documents and objects as vectors of identifiers is called the vector space model . 	The limitations of the vector space model are thus . 	225
In general , dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems , where the most efficient solution is needed . 	However , the key in Dynamic Programming is to determine the structure of optimal solutions . 	226
It is used in information filtering , information retrieval , indexing and relevancy rankings . 	A possible use for a vector space model is for retrieval and filtering of information . 	227
The easiest way to look at inheritance is as an `` ... is a kind of '' relationship . 	It also provides a way to generalize du to the `` is a '' relationship between classes . 	228
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass . 	It is `` prior '' in the sense that it does not take into account any information about B. 	229
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass . 	The method can be abused when people deliberately link to sites in order to raise a site 's PageRank . 	230
